# Plant Something
> Started off as a different project, now it's a relaxing sandbox garden!

### What to do
Hover over the 6x6 plot area to lay down ground and grow plants to completion.

### Misc
The plant graphics and animations were created in pure CSS ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ

Each plant stage is styled using a different CSS class that swaps out on hover. Animations are the result of elements transitioning between different CSS styles.

Plants have 4 stages of growth: seed, sapling, 3rd stage, adult

There's also a little ending transition once all of the plants have reached the adult stage :)
