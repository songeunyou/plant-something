# Plant Something
> Started off as a different project, now it's a relaxing sandbox garden!

### What to do
Hover over the 6x6 plot area to lay down ground and grow plants to completion. Just a fun thing to play with.

### Misc
The plant graphics and animations were created in pure CSS ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
* Each stage is a different class that swaps out on hover, animations are just the result of elements transitioning between different CSS specs

Plants have 4 stages of growth: seed, sapling, 3rd stage, adult so y'all need to do some hovering

There's also a little ending transition once all of the plants have reached the adult stage
